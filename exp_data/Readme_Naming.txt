Just to explain the naming of these files, which I named for concise brevity:

Basic name structure is <program><number of fish><number of cores><additional arguments>.out

So, para1m4c.out uses the p_fish_school.c code with 1 million fish and 4 cores.

Reruns of particular experiments have the suffix b. Usually these are because the batch ran out of time.

for the variable fish number experiments, _var means 1 million, 100k, 10k, 1k fish school sizes. _2var means twice those ie. 2 million, 200k...
